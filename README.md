1) Difference between var, let, and const: var is function-scoped and can be redeclared or updated, let is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared, const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared.

2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter(): map() returns a new array after transforming elements, forEach() loops through elements without returning a new array, filter() returns a new array with elements that pass a condition.

3) Arrow functions in ES6: shorter syntax for functions like `const add = (a, b) => a + b;` and `this` behaves differently than in regular functions.

4) Destructuring assignment in ES6: allows easy extraction of values from arrays or objects, e.g., `const [a, b] = [1, 2]; const {name, age} = {name:"Alice", age:25};`.

5) Template literals in ES6: use backticks `` ` `` to include variables and multi-line strings, e.g., `` `Hello, ${name}!` ``; cleaner than string concatenation and supports multi-line easily.
